        <p class="lead mb-4">I went to highschool at California Highs School. Due to a turn of very unfortunate events I ended up in University of California Riverside. I am now a Pre Business Major with a concetration in Marketing. I am doing good in school and am in a Business Club. I plan on getting an internship this summer. I will graduate class of 2026.The connection between humans and dogs begins when humans began to domesticate wolves around 15,000 years ago(). It is said that wolves began to approach humans for food and scraps from their campsites or humans began raising wolf puppies until wolves became more comfortable in the presence of humans. This led to a symbiotic relationship, where dogs would help with hunting and guarding while humans provided them with food and protection. As this relationship progressed humans began selectively breeding dogs based on specific traits such as size, friendliness, and speed. Dogs started becoming a fixture in human society as pets and as working animals. Today humans rely on dogs for companionship, protection, work, and more. They can be used to assist people with disabilities, aid the police and law enforcement, or provide emotional support. The complex relationship between humans and dogs can be seen almost anywhere in modern society, from movies to books and ads. The 2021-2022 National Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Association (APPA) found that nearly 40% of US households own at least one pet dog.  As humans and dogs begin to evolve together, it is improbable this relationship will end anytime soon. But why have dogs stayed with humans for so long? And what is the science behind the human-canine relationship? This essay will critically examine the human-dog relationship, how it was developed, the factors sustaining the relationship, and the science, and history behind the human-canine bond.As thousands of years passed and humankind evolved and the world changed, the bond between man and dog has not wavered. Anders Bergstrom, a geneticist at the Francis Crick Institute, stated in an interview, "We find that when we compare the history of dogs to the history of humans, to a quite large degree they mirror each other" This bond has been sustained because of three main factors; domestication, mutualistic symbiosis, and dogs' emotional intelligence. The domestication of dogs is the process by which wolves evolved into our modern-day dog. Domesticated animals are animals that have been selectively bred and genetically adapted over generations to live alongside humans. Humans have selected specific traits of dogs to breed to make them a better fit for our society. For example, large and strong dogs such as Mastiffs started being used as guard dogs while small dogs with stronger noses such as beagles were used for hunting. As dogs provide humans with specific qualities humans provide dogs with food, shelter, and companionship. This is called mutualistic symbiosis. According to an article by Biology Online,  mutualistic symbiosis is defined as, “a symbiotic relationship between individuals of different species in which both individuals benefit from the association. In this type of symbiosis, both organisms of different species rely on one another for nutrients, protection, and other life functions; hence, they are usually found living in close proximity”(). Both humans and dogs both benefit from their association and this has helped keep their bond strong. Finally, like humans, dogs are social creatures. Dogs can interpret and reciprocate human emotions, which helps humans see them as companions. In 2016, six scientists came together to test if dogs could understand human emotions. They presented dogs with either human or dog faces with different emotions such as happy, playful, angry, or aggressive. It is paired with a single vocalization from the same individual, either positive or negative. They found that the dogs looked significantly longer at the face whose expression matched the vocalization. This was an ability previously only seen in humans. These results demonstrate that dogs can understand and interrupt visual and vocal emotions, and can discriminate between positive and negative emotions from humans().
